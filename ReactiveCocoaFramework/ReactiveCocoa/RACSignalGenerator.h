/// An abstract class representing the logic for creating a signal from one
/// input value.

/// Instances represent a way to create signals at some later moment. Depending
/// on the specific subclass, there may also be side effects involved in the
/// generated signals and/or the generation algorithm itself.

/// This class forms an arrow `a ~> Signal b`. More simply, instances of the
/// class behave like -flattenMap:, except that they can be applied directly to
/// values (not just existing signals).

///         nil. This block must not be nil, and must not return a nil signal.

/// Returns an instance of a private RACSignalGenerator subclass (regardless of
/// which class this method is invoked upon).
